    "The GET method is used to submit the HTML form data. This data is collected by the predefined $_GET variable for processing.\n",
    "The information sent from an HTML form using the GET method is visible to everyone in the browser's address bar, which means that all the variable names and their values will be displayed in the URL.\n",
    "Therefore, the get method is not secured to send sensitive information.\n",

    "When the Flask application handles a request, it creates a Request object based on the environment it received from the WSGI server.\n",
